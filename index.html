About RetSKU:

RetSKU is a vertically integrated business intelligence and analytics platform focused on brands/cpg companies that sell through traditional “brick & mortar” retailers. 

Our addressable market is $25 Billion (yes!) and we compete with old-school incumbents like Nielson and IRI as well as traditional marketing consulting companies like Catalina & Dunnhumby.

In real-time, we collect data on the four pillars of retail: distribution, pricing, shelving and merchandizing. Essentially, which products (including competitive) are sold in the entire category at all retailers, at how many stores, which SKU they replaced (if any), what promotions are running, where the product is placed in the aisle and if it was on end-cap or not.

We are thus able to provide actionable insights like pinpointing drivers responsible for share increase/decrease for a competitive brand/SKU, opportunities for promotions based on variances (pricing, out-of-stock etc) across retailers (in real-time), gaps in a retailers assortment and many more.
